          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>My name is Nathan Squire, an IT student from Brisbane Australia.</p>
          <img alt="Nathan Squire" src="images/Profile.jpg"/>
          <p>These holidays I will be working in Nepal, doing IT things for a charity company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. This is my online journal documenting the trip.</p>
          <p>The family hosting me expects that I live by their culture, so I’ll be sleeping on a mat, practising meditation, and eating three meals a day of lentils, rice and curry, without cutlery. I’ll also be exploring as much as I can of the amazing mountains, countryside and villages. So it should be an interesting read.</p>

          <h3>The Plan</h3>
          <p>Hi, thanks for reading.</p>
          <p>These holidays I will be working in Nepal, for a charity company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. I won’t actually be rebuilding the village, just helping with some web design, general IT things, and most importantly writing some articles to get the word out there.</p>
          <p>One aspect of this will be keeping an online journal, and so if anyone is interested, you can read it here. Feel free to share it with friends and family too, every bit helps.</p>
