          <h3 style="width: 200px">How it all came about</h3>
          <p>Hey, thanks for reading. This is my first post, and I haven't left yet, so I guess I'll talk about how it all came about.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year I made a friend at a college party. She had been to Iceland and I was planning on going there with my family, so she told me all about it. That trip never ended up happening, but we stayed in touch despite that she wasn’t from around Brisbane.</p>
          <p>About three weeks ago she messaged me about a site where volunteers could work abroad in return for board. I had a look and came across a job in Kathmandu, Nepal, doing some IT stuff for a company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha, which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. I had always wanted to go to Nepal, and the work description was perfect for my studies. So I applied, and within the week I got the offer and booked my flights, scheduled to leave in three week’s time. Now all that’s left to be done is to go out and get some hiking shoes and a very big jumper.</p>
          <p>So, thank you to that friend.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 145px">Some research</h3>
          <p>Since booking my flights, I've started researching Nepali culture, as the host family I’ll be staying with expect me to live as they do. What I’ve found so far, is that I’ll most likely be sleeping on a mat each night, practising meditation, and eating three meals a day of little more than lentils, rice and curry, without cutlery - they just use their hands. I’ve also learnt that sitting with the soles of your feet visible is rude, and that two men holding hands in public is considered an act of friendship, and is completely normal.</p>
          <p>Good to know.</p>
