        <article>
          <h3 style="width: 200px">How it all came about</h3>
          <p>Hey, thanks for reading. This is my first post, and I haven't left yet, so I guess I'll talk about how it all came about.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year I made a friend at a college party. She had been to Iceland and I was planning on going there with my family, so she told me all about it. That trip never ended up happening, but we stayed in touch despite that she wasn’t from around Brisbane.</p>
          <p>About three weeks ago she messaged me about a site where volunteers could work abroad in return for board. I had a look and came across a job in Kathmandu, Nepal, doing some IT stuff for a company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha, which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. I had always wanted to go to Nepal, and the work description was perfect for my studies. So I applied, and within the week I got the offer and booked my flights, scheduled to leave in three week’s time. Now all that’s left to be done is to go out and get some hiking shoes and a very big jumper.</p>
          <p>So, thank you to that friend.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 145px">Some research</h3>
          <p>Since booking my flights, I've started researching Nepali culture, as the host family I’ll be staying with expect me to live as they do. What I’ve found so far, is that I’ll most likely be sleeping on a mat each night, practising meditation, and eating three meals a day of little more than lentils, rice and curry, without cutlery - they just use their hands. I’ve also learnt that sitting with the soles of your feet visible is rude, and that two men holding hands in public is considered an act of friendship, and is completely normal.</p>
          <p>Good to know.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 145px">The Ghorepani Trek</h3>
          <p>Day One. I played some mandolin, had tea, and then a breakfast of rice pudding and curry. Shiva and I then walked across the river to the bus station, and caught a bus to Pokhara. It took quite a while to get out of the city, as we first had to fill the bus, then got caught in the hectic traffic, and then got caught behind road works. Finally once were in the hills we made faster progress, and it was really beautiful, with three river, villages, and the snow capped mountains ahead. I listened to junkyard chandelier, spooks, and then the Nepali music playing through the very base heavy bus speakers. We had a lunch of samosas and some kind of vegetable curry balls at a roadside restaurant. It was dark by the time we arrived, and so after checking into our hotel we walked into the streets and found a place for dinner. Then I had a proper shower, it was great.
            Day Two. I had muesli for breakfast at the hotel, a nice change. Then we walked to the lake and through the lakeside street, which looks really cool with lots of bars advertising live music. I think I might be back. We stopped to look at some flutes before catching a very shiny and colorful bus further into the mountains. As soon as we arrived we began the trek; first along the river and through rice paddy hills, and then up the mountainside and through many little villages. Along the way we stopped for lunch at one of these, as well as the corn and nuts we ate as we walked. After a final climb of 3500 steps we came to the village we would be staying at for the night not long before dark. We rested up and then ate dinner with the four other trekkers staying at the guest house and their guides. The five of us spent the evening talking about our travels so far, our plans, Nepali culture and Nepali food.
            Day Three. After breakfast with the other travelers we set off. The walk to Ghorepani led through the rainforest; we saw waterfalls, villages, monkeys, birds, buffalos, and, as we came over the hills, the mountains. They were suddenly much closer and we could see a large section of the range from where we would stay the night. We had lunch taking in the amazing view. After having a rest we walked up to poon hill, it was steep but felt easy without our packs, and the view was amazing. While we waited for sunset there I talked to Mara from Germany, who we had met the night before at the guest house, about our plans in Nepal, her time in India, my time in Germany, traveling in general, and many other things. After watching the sunset paint the mountains orange we walked back down and said or goodbyes, and she promised to come on a walking tour in Kathmandu so we could meet again.
            Day Four. We woke early and could see the sunrise over the hills out the window. After breakfast we headed off and over the next couple hours we walked along the top of a range, and so we had amazing views of the mountains and hills to each side. Then the path led through a forest and along a stream with nice waterfalls and rock pools. One of the waterfalls was surrounded by hundreds of rock stupors; stacks of flat rocks which passerby's add to for good luck. We came to a section of the path which was layered in loose rock, and Shiva stopped us for a moment to study the small rocks rolling down the cliff face, then he told me we would pass through quickly, as their had and possibly would be a landslide. Later on the path was blocked by buffalos, and so we found our way around staying clear of them. We had a lunch at a small town with a good view of the mountains, and then we continued on again. We arrived at our hostel in the afternoon, in a Gurung village, of the kind known for their beautiful slate rock roof houses. I had a rest and then went for a walk around the village as the sun was setting.
            Day Five. Shiva and I went for a quick walk around the town for sunrise. Then for breakfast I had a really nice banana pancake. We hiked the final hour of the trek and then caught the bus back to Pokhara. Shiva left me there and caught a bus back to Kathmandu, while I had a proper shower and then walked around lakeside and had lunch at a cool place.</p>
