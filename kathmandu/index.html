        <article>
          <h3 style="width: 200px">How it all came about</h3>
          <p>Hey, thanks for reading. This is my first post, and I haven't left yet, so I guess I'll talk about how it all came about.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year I made a friend at a college party. She had been to Iceland and I was planning on going there with my family, so she told me all about it. That trip never ended up happening, but we stayed in touch despite that she wasn’t from around Brisbane.</p>
          <p>About three weeks ago she messaged me about a site where volunteers could work abroad in return for board. I had a look and came across a job in Kathmandu, Nepal, doing some IT stuff for a company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha, which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. I had always wanted to go to Nepal, and the work description was perfect for my studies. So I applied, and within the week I got the offer and booked my flights, scheduled to leave in three week’s time. Now all that’s left to be done is to go out and get some hiking shoes and a very big jumper.</p>
          <p>So, thank you to that friend.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 145px">Some research</h3>
          <p>Since booking my flights, I've started researching Nepali culture, as the host family I’ll be staying with expect me to live as they do. What I’ve found so far, is that I’ll most likely be sleeping on a mat each night, practising meditation, and eating three meals a day of little more than lentils, rice and curry, without cutlery - they just use their hands. I’ve also learnt that sitting with the soles of your feet visible is rude, and that two men holding hands in public is considered an act of friendship, and is completely normal.</p>
          <p>Good to know.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 185px">Kathmandu: Day One</h3>
          <p>At the airport, and on the plane to Nepal I read ‘Canone Inverso’, listened to ‘Ephemera’ and chatted with the guy next to me, who had been to Nepal before and told me all about it. We could see the Himalayas as we flew in, and the Nepali guy on the other side of me pointed out Mt Everest. After getting through immigration I found Shiva waiting for me, he seems really nice. We got a taxi through the city, and it was good to watch and soak in the streets on the way to the little apartment where I would be staying. The destruction caused by the earthquake was obvious, as was the extent of the poverty. I met Shiva’s family, and they seem just as nice, friendly and happy and I was shown to my simple room. We had tea and then sat down on the floor for a dinner of rice, lentil and cauliflower curry, it was good. We ate with no cutlery, just our hands, which proved a bit difficult but I was improving. We talked about the company, our families, and our day tomorrow. Then we went to bed - mine was just a mat and a blanket over a wooden frame.

          <h3 style="width: 185px">Kathmandu: Day Two</h3>
          <p>We had tea, and then I had shower. Because the shower - which is just a waist hight tap in the bathroom - does not have hot water, they boil some, and wash themselves from a bucket. It was quite cold between each round of pouring the bucket over my head but otherwise it wasn’t too bad. After a breakfast of curry, papadums and rice Shiva and I walked to the office and did a bit of work. Afterwards we walked through Thamel, the hippie tourist area, which was cool. There was a man playing one of the traditional Nepali violin-like instruments. For lunch we had pear and uncooked rice in yoghurt, which was really good. It had to be chewed excessively in order to be actually ingested. I had a cup of tea and sat at the stairs watching the kids play soccer outside. I played some mandolin, and Shiva joined me on the bamboo flute. I mostly improvised picking with double stops along to his flute which was in G. Once we worked it out they sounded really good together. We went shopping and I got a jacket for trekking and some thongs. Sinbatiya(?) and I walked back and he gave me a history lesson of Nepal. I learnt ‘Mykonos’ on mandolin, and then Shiva and I had another mando-flute jam. For dinner we sat on the floor and had rice and curry again, with some chicken.

          <h3 style="width: 185px">Kathmandu: Day Three</h3>
          <p>I had a cup of tea, it was really nice in the cold. Then we had some breakfast, and me and Shiva headed into Thamel. We bought a sim card for me on the way, and stopped by the office before meeting two tourists at the garden of the moon(?) for the beginning of the walking tour. We walked through the hippie district to some temples and to a local marketplace. Then we walked to the monkey temple: a set of stupors, buddhas and shrines covered in prayer flags and overrun with monkeys. We caught a bus back, and I rested at the house for a while. I messaged Josie, Peppa and Mum and Dad about how things were going, then I played some mandolin. We had some fruit, fried rice, samosas and tea. After dark there was a wedding ceremony moving through the streets playing Nepali instruments, so me and Shiva followed them and had a look. We had dinner, and then slept.

          <h3 style="width: 185px">Kathmandu: Day Four</h3>
          <p>After a cup of tea and breakfast, Shiva and I headed into Thamel. We organised the hike in the office, and then we did another walking tour of Kathmandu. This time I just took in all in rather than taking pictures for a video. We stopped along the way and got Mo Mo’s for lunch, they were really nice. Afterwards we caught a bus to a place where we got hiking permits, and then went back to Thamel to buy a beanie and the office to organise money. We walked back to the house and had tea, and then I went out and bought some warm pants.

          <h3 style="width: 250px">The Ghorepani Trek: Day Five</h3>
          <p>I played some mandolin, had tea, and then a breakfast of rice pudding and curry. Shiva and I then walked across the river to the bus station, and caught a bus to Pokhara. It took quite a while to get out of the city, as we first had to fill the bus, then got caught in the hectic traffic, and then got caught behind road works. Finally once were in the hills we made faster progress, and it was really beautiful, with three river, villages, and the snow capped mountains ahead. I listened to junkyard chandelier, spooks, and then the Nepali music playing through the very base heavy bus speakers. We had a lunch of samosas and some kind of vegetable curry balls at a roadside restaurant. It was dark by the time we arrived, and so after checking into our hotel we walked into the streets and found a place for dinner. Then I had a proper shower, it was great.

          <h3 style="width: 250px">The Ghorepani Trek: Day Six</h3>
          <p>I had muesli for breakfast at the hotel, a nice change. Then we walked to the lake and through the lakeside street, which looks really cool with lots of bars advertising live music. I think I might be back. We stopped to look at some flutes before catching a very shiny and colorful bus further into the mountains. As soon as we arrived we began the trek; first along the river and through rice paddy hills, and then up the mountainside and through many little villages. Along the way we stopped for lunch at one of these, as well as the corn and nuts we ate as we walked. After a final climb of 3500 steps we came to the village we would be staying at for the night not long before dark. We rested up and then ate dinner with the four other trekkers staying at the guest house and their guides. The five of us spent the evening talking about our travels so far, our plans, Nepali culture and Nepali food.

          <h3 style="width: 250px">The Ghorepani Trek: Day Seven</h3>
          <p>We woke early and could see the sunrise over the hills out the window. After breakfast we headed off and over the next couple hours we walked along the top of a range, and so we had amazing views of the mountains and hills to each side. Then the path led through a forest and along a stream with nice waterfalls and rock pools. One of the waterfalls was surrounded by hundreds of rock stupors; stacks of flat rocks which passerby's add to for good luck. We came to a section of the path which was layered in loose rock, and Shiva stopped us for a moment to study the small rocks rolling down the cliff face, then he told me we would pass through quickly, as their had and possibly would be a landslide. Later on the path was blocked by buffalos, and so we found our way around staying clear of them. We had a lunch at a small town with a good view of the mountains, and then we continued on again. We arrived at our hostel in the afternoon, in a Gurung village, of the kind known for their beautiful slate rock roof houses. I had a rest and then went for a walk around the village as the sun was setting.

          <p>Shiva and I went for a quick walk around the town for sunrise. Then for breakfast I had a really nice banana pancake. We hiked the final hour of the trek and then caught the bus back to Pokhara. Shiva left me there and caught a bus back to Kathmandu, while I had a proper shower and then walked around lakeside and had lunch at a cool place. I bought a terry pratchet book and some prayer flags, and then, as I had a headache, I went back to the hostel and had a rest. I went into the main street of lakeside to watch some live music; I stayed for a while in four different places and the musicians were great. One band were just improvising on guitar, bass and kahun while I was having a hot chocolate, and then the vocalist arrived and they played a great cover of "How I wish you were here".

          <h3 style="width: 180px">Pokhara: Day Ten</h3>
          <p>For breakfast I walked into central lakeside to go to a rooftop crepes place I had noticed the day before. They were really good, and the view of the lake was nice. Then I started my long walk into the city. My first stop was the mountain festival, which was a bit disappointing as I has expected it to be a more traditional local event. It was fun however being around all the eastern Nepalese tourists who were in total awe of me; constantly asking me questions and getting photos with me. Next I walked to Devis waterfall, and saw it from above ground and then from the caves underneath. I bought a couple small things from the markets there too. Then I walked up to the world peace pagoda. During my travels I have been to many temples, shrines, churchs and religious sites, but this one despite the actual building being much less magnificent, is by far my favourite. I felt a huge sense of peacefulness and power as I walked around it, maybe because of the amazing views over the city, the lake, and the mountain range, or maybe because of the shade and coolness of the stone on my bare feet after climbing so far up in the heat and the utter silence after the noise of the city. I then went to one of the nearby roof top cafes and had some mo mos while taking in the view a little longer. As I started heading back down a group of backpackers invited me to join them: sisters Mari and Natalie from Germany, and Oscar from Guatemala. We chatted for a while about our travels; they were all spending a long time in Pokhara. Then we walked down to the city through the forest, Mari and I talked about other places we had been, trekking, and university while the others were somewhere behind us. We walked through Damside, then through lakeside further than I had been before to go to a falafel restaurant for dinner. There we met Amanda from the UK who joined us as we all ate and exchanged travel stories.

          <h3 style="width: 180px">Pokhara: Day Eleven</h3>
          <p>I checked out of my hotel and had an early breakfast there before deciding I was too sick to take the long bus ride back to Kathmandu, so I walked to north lake and found a hostel there to stay one more night. This place (Apex Hostel) was half the price and had a much better feel to it, I even had lake views from my room. I then went for a walk further again around the lake, eventually getting to local farmlands. I had another banana nutella crepe, and then I had a nap, then started reading "Seven years in Tibet". Later I found a cool place for lunch; a rooftop bar with a view of the lake, seating on the floor, graffiti on the walls, prayer flags on the roof and my own choice of music - as I was the only one there. So I chose some Mumford and Sons, some acoustic Led Zeppelin and some Winterbourne. In the afternoon I did some more reading and napping, determined to get better before the bus ride the next day. Just before sunset I went for a walk, and came across the local skate park. I was standing by and watching when Santosh, a local boy of about ten, offered me his board. I hadn't actually skated at a park before, and so he had to teach me how to drop in. I fell off a couple times, to the amusement of the local kids, before finally mastering it. Before I left Santosh and I agreed to stay in touch. I walked further around the town and by sunset I came to the actual lake along central lakeside, I had been to lake at view points on each end, and I had walked up the street of lakeside many times, but hadn't known about this walkway right along the water. There were some nice restaurants with fire pits burning and live bands playing, so I decided to have dinner there, it was very nice.

          <h3 style="width: 180px">Pokhara: Day Twelve</h3>
          <p>I was up before the sun, to check out of my room and start the walk to the bus station, grabbing some muffins for breakfast on the way. At the bus station I happened upon Mara from Germany who was also catching a bus to Kathmandu. We caught up and this time exchanged contact details so we could stay in touch. The bus ride was long, but the scenery was nice and I now had books to read as well as music to listen to. We were dropped off near Thamel and I walked my way back to Shiva's home, where I was greeted warmly and with a cup of tea.
