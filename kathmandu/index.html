        <article>
          <h3 style="width: 300px">How it all came about</h3>
          <p>Hey, thanks for reading. This is my first post, and I haven't left yet, so I guess I'll talk about how it all came about.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year I made a friend at a college party. She had been to Iceland and I was planning on going there with my family, so she told me all about it. That trip never ended up happening, but we stayed in touch despite that she wasn’t from around Brisbane.</p>
          <p>About three weeks ago she messaged me about a site where volunteers could work abroad in return for board. I had a look and came across a job in Kathmandu, Nepal, doing some IT stuff for a company dedicated to rebuilding the village of Gorkha, which was destroyed in the earthquakes last year. I had always wanted to go to Nepal, and the work description was perfect for my studies. So I applied, and within the week I got the offer and booked my flights, scheduled to leave in three week’s time. Now all that’s left to be done is to go out and get some hiking shoes and a very big jumper.</p>
          <p>So, thank you to that friend.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Some research</h3>
          <p>Since booking my flights, I've started researching Nepali culture, as the host family I’ll be staying with expect me to live as they do. What I’ve found so far, is that I’ll most likely be sleeping on a mat each night, practising meditation, and eating three meals a day of little more than lentils, rice and curry, without cutlery - they just use their hands. I’ve also learnt that sitting with the soles of your feet visible is rude, and that two men holding hands in public is considered an act of friendship, and is completely normal.</p>
          <p>Good to know.</p>

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day One: Kathmandu</h3>
          <p>At the airport, and on the plane to Nepal I read ‘Canone Inverso’, listened to ‘Ephemera’ and chatted with the guy next to me, who had been to Nepal before and told me all about it. We could see the Himalayas as we flew in, and the Nepali guy on the other side of me pointed out Mt Everest. After getting through immigration I found Shiva waiting for me, and we got a taxi through the city, it was good to watch and soak in the streets on the way to the little apartment where I would be staying. The destruction caused by the earthquake was obvious, as was the extent of the poverty.
          </p><p>Once we arrived I met Shiva’s family, they seem very nice, friendly and happy, and I was shown to my simple room. We had tea and then sat down on the floor for a dinner of rice, lentil and cauliflower curry, it was good. We ate with no cutlery, just our hands, which proved a bit difficult but I was improving. We talked about the company, our families, and our day tomorrow. Then we went to bed - mine was just a mat and a blanket over a wooden frame.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Two: Jams</h3>
          <p>We had tea, and then I had shower. Because the shower - which is just a waist hight tap in the bathroom - does not have hot water, they boil some, and wash themselves from a bucket. It was quite cold between each round of pouring the bucket over my head but otherwise it wasn’t too bad. After a breakfast of curry, papadums and rice Shiva and I walked to the office and did a bit of work.
          </p><p>Afterwards we walked through Thamel, the hippie tourist area, which was cool. There was a man playing one of the traditional Nepali violin-like instruments.
          </p><p>For lunch we had pear and uncooked rice in yoghurt, which was really good. It had to be chewed excessively in order to be actually ingested. I had a cup of tea and sat at the stairs watching the kids play soccer outside. I played some mandolin, and Shiva joined me on the bamboo flute. I mostly improvised picking with double stops along to his flute which was in G. Once we worked it out they sounded really good together.
          </p><p>We went shopping and I got a jacket for trekking and some thongs. Sabinaya and I walked back and he gave me a history lesson of Nepal. I learnt ‘Mykonos’ on mandolin, and then Shiva and I had another mando-flute jam. For dinner we sat on the floor and had rice and curry again, with some chicken.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Three: The walking tour</h3>
          <p>I had a cup of tea, it was really nice in the cold. Then we had some breakfast, and me and Shiva headed into Thamel. We bought a sim card for me on the way, and stopped by the office before meeting two tourists at the Garden of Dreams for the beginning of the walking tour. We walked through the hippie district to some temples and to a local marketplace. Shiva taught us a lot about the religious meanings behind the buildings, traditions and symbols. Then we walked to the monkey temple: a set of stupors, buddhas and shrines covered in prayer flags and overrun with monkeys.
          </p><p>We caught a bus back, and I rested at the house for a while. I messaged friends and family from home about how things were going, then I played some mandolin. We had some fruit, fried rice, samosas and tea. After dark there was a wedding ceremony moving through the streets playing Nepali instruments, so me and Shiva followed them and had a look. We had dinner, and then slept.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Four</h3>
          <p>After a cup of tea and breakfast, Shiva and I headed into Thamel. We organised the hike in the office, and then we did another walking tour of Kathmandu. This time I just took in all in rather than taking pictures for a video. We stopped along the way and got Mo Mo’s for lunch, they were really nice. Afterwards we caught a bus to a place where we got hiking permits, and then went back to Thamel to buy a beanie and the office to organise money. We walked back to the house and had tea, and then I went out and bought some warm pants.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Five</h3>
          <p>I played some mandolin, had tea, and then breakfast; rice pudding and curry. Shiva and I walked across the river to the bus station, and caught a bus to Pokhara. It took quite a while to get out of the city, as we first had to fill the bus, then got caught in the hectic traffic, and then got caught behind road works. Finally once were in the hills we made faster progress, and the scenery also improved. It was really beautiful, with the river and villages below us, and the snow capped mountains in the distance ahead. I listened to a bit of my own music and then to the Nepali music playing through the very base heavy bus speakers. We had a lunch of samosas and some kind of vegetable curry balls at a roadside restaurant, they were good. It was dark by the time we arrived, and so after checking into our hotel we walked into the streets and found a place for dinner. Then I had a proper shower before bed, which was nice.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Six: The Climb</h3>
          <p>I had muesli for breakfast at the hotel, a nice change. Then we walked to the lake and through the lakeside street, which looks interesting - lots of cool bars advertising live music. I think I might be coming back for a while. We stopped to look at some Nepali flutes before catching a very shiny and colorful bus further into the mountains. The ride was very scenic, leading along the side of, and up into, the mountains.
          </p><p>As soon as we arrived we began the trek; first along the river and through rice paddy hills, and then up the mountainside and through many little traditional Nepali villages. Along the way we stopped for lunch at one of these, in addition to the corn and nuts we ate as we walked the trail. The final climb was of 3500 steps, and the view of the valley below improved with each one. We came to the village we would be staying at for the night not long before dark, I was quite exhausted. We rested up and then ate dinner with the four other trekkers staying at the guest house and their guides. Together we spent the evening talking about our travels so far, our plans, Nepali culture and Nepali food.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Seven: Poon Hill</h3>
          <p>
          After having breakfast with the few other trekkers at our hostel we set off on the walk to Ghorepani. The path first led through the rainforest; we saw waterfalls, villages, monkeys, birds, buffalos, and, as we came over the hills, the mountains.
          They were suddenly much closer and by the time we reached the village we could see a large section of the range, including The Fishtail and Annapurna I. We had lunch taking in this amazing view.
          </p><p>
          After having a rest we walked up to Poon Hill, it was steep but felt easy without our packs, and the view was amazing. We could see the same mountains but from higher up once again, as well as the fog surrounded hills and valleys down below us to the other side.
          </p><p>
          While we waited for sunset there I talked to Mara from Germany, one of the other trekkers from the guest house last night, about our plans and travels. Slowly the sun fell down upon the hills and the mountains were painted a magnificent orange.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Eight: Rock Stupors</h3>
          <p>I woke early and could see the sunrise breaking through the fog over the hills out the window. After breakfast Shiva and I started walking, for the first couple of hours, along the top of a range - and so we had amazing views of the snow capped mountains to our left and haze surrounded hills to the right.
          </p><p>
          The path then led through a forest and along a stream with bubbling waterfalls and rock pools. One of the waterfalls was surrounded by hundreds of rock stupors; stacks of flat rocks which passerby's add to for good luck. We came to a section of the path which was layered in loose rock, and Shiva stopped us for a moment to study the small rocks rolling down the cliff face, then he told me we would pass through quickly, as their had and possibly would be a landslide. Later on the path was blocked by buffalos, and so we found our own way around, staying clear of them but watching them with curiosity.
          </p><p>
          We had a lunch, some mo mo's and chapati, at a small town with a good view of the mountains, and then we continued on again through similar forestry. We arrived at our hostel in the afternoon, a nice place in a Gurung village, of the kind known for their beautiful slate rock roof houses. I had a rest and then went for a walk around the village to explore as the sun was setting.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Nine</h3>
          <p>Shiva and I went for a quick walk around the town for sunrise. The houses are quite beautiful; with white walls, dark stone slate roofs, and bright red or blue windows and doors. Many of the walls were lined with corn or beehives. For breakfast we ate at our guesthouse, and I had a really nice banana pancake. We hiked the final hour of the trek down to a village at the base of the valley, and from there caught the bus back to Pokhara.
          </p><p>Shiva left me there and caught a bus back to Kathmandu, while I had a proper shower and then walked around lakeside and had lunch at a cool place. I bought some books and some prayer flags, and then  I went back to the hostel and had a rest. I went into the main street of lakeside to watch some live music; I stayed for a while in four different places and the musicians were great. One band were just improvising on guitar, bass and kahun while I was having a hot chocolate, and then the vocalist arrived and they played a great cover of "How I wish you were here".

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Ten: Pokhara</h3>
          <p>For breakfast I walked into central lakeside to go to a rooftop crepes place I had noticed the day before. They were really good, and the view of the lake was nice. Then I started my long walk into the city.
          </p><p>My first stop was the mountain festival, which was a bit disappointing as I has expected it to be a more traditional local event. It was fun however being around all the eastern Nepalese tourists who were in total awe of me; constantly asking me questions and getting photos with me.
          </p><p>Next I walked to Devis waterfall, and saw it from above ground and then from the caves underneath. I bought a couple small things from the markets there too.
          </p><p>Then I walked up to the world peace pagoda. During my travels I have been to many temples, shrines, churchs and religious sites, but this one despite the actual building being much less magnificent, is by far my favourite. I felt a huge sense of peacefulness and power as I walked around it, maybe because of the amazing views over the city, the lake, and the mountain range, or maybe because of the shade and coolness of the stone on my bare feet after climbing so far up in the heat and the utter silence after the noise of the city.
          </p><p>I then went to one of the nearby roof top cafes and had some mo mos while taking in the view a little longer. As I started heading back down a group of backpackers invited me to join them: sisters Mari and Natalie from Germany, and Oscar from Guatemala. We chatted for a while about our travels; they were all spending a long time in Pokhara. Then we walked down to the city through the forest, Mari and I talked about other places we had been, trekking, and university while the others were somewhere behind us.
          </p><p>We walked through Damside, then through lakeside further than I had been before to go to a falafel restaurant for dinner. There we met Amanda from the UK who joined us as we all ate and exchanged travel stories.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Eleven: Skating</h3>
          <p>I checked out of my hotel and had an early breakfast there before deciding I was too sick to take the long bus ride back to Kathmandu, so I walked to north lake and found a hostel there to stay one more night. This place (Apex Hostel) was half the price and had a much better feel to it, I even had lake views from my room. I then went for a walk further again around the lake, eventually getting to local farmlands.
          </p><p>I had another banana nutella crepe, and then I had a nap, then started reading "Seven years in Tibet". Later I found a cool place for lunch; a rooftop bar with a view of the lake, seating on the floor, graffiti on the walls, prayer flags on the roof and my own choice of music - as I was the only one there. So I chose some Mumford and Sons, some acoustic Led Zeppelin and some Winterbourne.
          </p><p>In the afternoon I did some more reading and napping, determined to get better before the bus ride the next day. Just before sunset I went for a walk, and came across the local skate park. I was standing by and watching when Santosh, a local boy of about ten, offered me his board. I hadn't actually skated at a park before, and so he had to teach me how to drop in. I fell off a couple times, to the amusement of the local kids, before finally mastering it. Before I left Santosh and I agreed to stay in touch.
          </p><p>I walked further around the town and by sunset I came to the actual lake along central lakeside, I had been to lake at view points on each end, and I had walked up the street of lakeside many times, but hadn't known about this walkway right along the water. There were some nice restaurants with fire pits burning and live bands playing, so I decided to have dinner there, it was very nice.
          </p>

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Twelve</h3>
          <p>I was up before the sun, to check out of my room and start the walk to the bus station, grabbing some muffins for breakfast on the way. At the bus station I happened upon Mara from Germany who was also catching a bus to Kathmandu. We caught up and this time exchanged contact details so we could stay in touch.
          </p><p>The bus ride was long, but the scenery was nice and I now had books to read as well as music to listen to. We were dropped off near Thamel and I walked my way back to Shiva's home, where I was greeted warmly and with a cup of tea. I played some mandolin, glad not to have forgotten everything, and then we had dinner.
          </p>

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Thirteen</h3>
          <p>As I had my cup of tea, I read some of ‘Seven Years In Tibet’, then it was breakfast time. Shiva and I walked into work, he had a tour so I stayed and did some blog writing and posting on facebook. I got Himkala Adventures 50 new likes from friends. On the walk home a small group of Nepali Christians were celebrating Christmas by singing, playing instruments and dancing on the side of the road, so we watched for a while. For dinner we had curry and roti.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Fourteen</h3>
          <p>Shiva and I had a mando flute jam before breakfast. Then we headed into work, I made a video for the Ghorepani trek. We had chow mein for lunch, as well as corn, peanuts and tea. We walked back and I had a shower, then Shiva’s wife taught me to make two curries, which we had for dinner. I wrote down the recipe but I think I got a few details wrong in translation.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Fifteen</h3>
          <p>After breakfast we walked into work. I worked on the walking tour video, until my laptop ran out of power; then I went downstairs for chow mein, as there was no power. I loaded some music onto Shiva’s computer and set up itunes for him. I walked back while he went to buy a few things in Thamel, and I re-learnt some old songs on mandolin. As it got late I did so in the dark, as there was no power at home either.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Sixteen</h3>
          <p>We woke up early and rushed to have breakfast and make the bus to the Langtang region. The ride took all day, once again the Nepali music was blasting the whole way. The last few hours of the journey were up in the hills; the progress was at a snail pace but the scenery was nice. The road was just dirt and barely as wide as the bus, and so whenever a vehicle came from the other direction either one of us would have to reverse up to the nearest fork or widening in the road. Some parts were so steep the road would wind back on itself six or seven times without making any forwards progress. It was nice to go for a stroll once we arrived in the afternoon. The village we were at for the night was clearly heavily impacted by the earthquakes; many buildings, a year on, were still nothing more than skeletons of rubble. Australian and American aid tents were still set up, despite, I'm quite sure, no longer being used for aid. The people and the culture seemed slightly different, Shiva said this was because the region was very Tibetan influenced. We had dinner at the guest house with the only other guest, a French man who was hiking alone.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Seventeen</h3>
          <p>We had an early start, walking first the way we had gone the afternoon before, starting at about 1400m above sea level. From there we went on further up the valley, following the rocky aqua stream. Immediately I realised this trek was going to follow much less of a beaten track then the Poon Hill trek, the path in some places was barely visible. We crossed the river a number of times, over suspension bridges laden with prayer flags. One of these was very questionable; the steel frame holding it up at one end was leaning at a forty five degree angle. We saw a lot of wildlife along the way; monkeys in the trees and even on the path, yaks grazing on the cliff edges, bee hives hanging from the rocks, mules, squirrels and birds. Shiva pointed out what he thought to be fresh leopard droppings on the track. We had lunch at a little restaurant by the stream, because the tracks had been so quiet they were only serving one thing: vegetable fried rice. It was good, although I would have enjoyed any meal with such a view. Later in the afternoon we came to our stop for the night, a very peaceful little Tibetan village at 2400m. I went and sat by the river for a while, taking it in. Then at our guest house I had a cup of tea with yak's milk, which tasted odd and I'm still unsure about it. I had a freezing shower, and then went and warmed myself by the fire, reading my book. Later we had dinner by the fire, it seemed to be just us and the family that ran the place.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">The Desolation of Langtang</h3>
          <p>After a nice breakfast of pancakes and porridge we headed off. The trail started off much like the day before, through the forest and along the stream. Then it took us higher up in the valley, and the land became far more barren; consisting of mostly thorny dry bushes and rock. Yaks grazed the fields, standing motionless and watching us as we watched them. We stopped at a guest house for lunch, and as we had our Dal Baht we were joined by three other trekkers, the first we had seen all day. We continued on and soon came to where the old village of Langtang had been destroyed in the avalanche. It was now a desert, a huge space of nothing but rock and the occasional reminder of what had been: lost pots and bowls, torn mattresses, and destroyed pieces of metal appliances. At the far side was a prayer flag laden monument to those who had died, 175 locals and many tourists also. The new village was built not far onwards, the houses were more modern but built still in the Tibetan style, here we would stay the night. The guest house had a proper shower, so after enjoying that I sat by the window reading my book and watching the sun set over the valley.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Kyanjin Ri</h3>
          <p>As the cook had left for work before sunrise, we could not get breakfast at our guest house, so we started walking and found a tea house to eat at. The whole family gathered around the fireplace to help cook my porridge. We continued on, and as we did the snowy mountains rose up ahead of us. The town we would stay at for the night was nestled inbetween a number of these peaks, and so when we arrived by lunch time we had a quick meal and started climbing one of the smaller ones. It was called Kyanjin Ri and by small, it was 4700 metres high. Despite having no packs to carry it was the most difficult climb of the trek so far, but the view of the mountains, villages, glaciers and frozen lakes was amazing. We began climbing higher still to the second peak, but I began to suffer from a combination of dehydration and altitude sickness, and so we turned around. By the time we got back I had a bad headache, so I went to sleep early. During the night I woke and pulled back the curtains to see the incredibly bright stars over the moon lit mountains.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Mandolins and Bonsais; of the Nepali kind</h3>
          <p>I was feeling better in the morning so after breakfast Shiva and I walked up to the frozen lake, it was a nice view. The hillside was spotted with amazing natural bonsais, crafted by the strong winds and the continually grazing of the yaks. After an early lunch we started the long walk back; we planned to go all the way to Bamboo, the village we had eaten lunch at on the first day. It was down hill the whole way, and we kept up a fast pace, eventually the sun set and we walked the last hour in darkness. I was glad we made it to Bamboo, for after a nice dinner the host of our guest house brought out his instrument. The instrument was local to the Langtang region, it was like a small wooden mandolin, with no frets and a skin covered body like a banjo. This particular one was carved with a dragon's head above the tuning pegs. He played for us, and even gave me a try. He couldn't tell me what the tuning was, but I found a few notes and with a mandolin strumming pattern I could make a nice tune. Eventually our hosts put out the fire and went to bed, and so, as there were no other sources of light, did I.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Thulo Syabru</h3>
          <p>I woke up early and watched the stream for a while before joining out hosts for breakfast by the fireplace. I tried Tsampa, it was very bland but okay. Our hosts told us how ten military men had been sent into the valley to catch some poachers - the endangered musk deer are poached for a fragrant chemical in their navel. We trekked up the side of the valley, adjacent to the way we had come, through the forest. We saw lots of monkeys, and some Monal birds. We came to a really nice village on a rice paddied hillside, Thulo Syabru. For dinner I had T mo mos, which are basically mo mos without the filling, with curry, and it was really nice. One of the hosts was interested in mandolins, so I told him about my two, and I told him to listen to Winterbourne. For the first time since starting the trek we had internet, so I talked to friends at home.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Twenty Two</h3>
          <p>I went for a walk around the village, to a stupor and along some terraces. Then had a cinnamon and peanut butter pancake for breakfast, overlooking the valley. It was very nice. We started walking back out of the valley, and could see many distant mountains for most of the way. Then we came onto a road, and I listened to Winterbourne as we went. The town we would stay at for the night didn't seem so interesting, so after lunch and walk around, we rested at the hotel. I messaged Notey and Verity and other friends from home.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Twenty Three</h3>
          <p>We woke up early and had some tea before catching the bus back to Kathmandu. This time I had sat on the right side, and had amazing views of the valleys and the clouds below us. I listened to three Radical Face albums and watched out the window as we went. We stopped at a roadside restaurant for a lunch of Dal Baht, then continued on, and finally arrived in Kathmandu in the afternoon. It was nice to be back in my room, having a cup of tea, playing mandolin, and drawing some things I had promised Gracie; a stupa and a temple.

          <p>I did some writing, and some drawing, while I sipped my morning tea. After breakfast we walked into work. I made a video for Shiva’s walking tour, put together the audio and video for Shiva and I’s mando-flute jam, and helped him put some songs on his phone, he was very happy with me. Mum and Dad me a call as it was Christmas, and we had a chat. Then Shiva and I walked around Thamel to see if there were any Christmas things going on, but there wasn’t really. So we headed home and had dinner; millet and curry. It was like a black, tasteless sludge that they eat in the mountains.

          <p>I played mandolin and had a freezing shower before breakfast. Then we walked into work, Shiva had a tour so I stayed in the office on my own and made a video for the Langtang trek as well as doing a graphic and a few other little things. Shiva, once he got back, was very happy again with what I had done, and we had tea and Chowmein. We walked back in the afternoon and I did some reading. For dinner we had rice pudding and curry wrapped in roti, it was really good.

          <p>I did some writing while drinking my tea. Then we had breakfast, the usual, and Shiva and I walked into work. I did some quote pictures, made some facebook posts, and did some for instagram too. We walked back early, and I played some mandolin before we had lunch - beaten rice in two minute noodles, it was surprisingly really good. I did some writing in the afternoon, and some reading. Before dinner Shiva and I had another jam, and we learnt to play Winter Winds together.

          <p>I had tea and wrote. I’m liking the habit, and will try to continue it next year. Then we had breakfast and went into work. I wrote an article on travelling in Nepal, installed musescore on Shiva’s computer, and then we left early. We had noodles and beaten rice for lunch again, another thing I may make a norm next year. I did some reading, and relaxed for a bit. Shiva and I walked into Machupokari and bought and adapter for me. Then I went back and relaxed a bit a more. I played mando and did lots of writing before dinner.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Bandipur</h3>
          <p>We woke up early, and after a hurried shower and breakfast we caught the bus towards Pokhara. I listened to Electric President on the way, and admired the view. At a roadside restaurant we had Dahl Baht, and I met an Australian who was working in India as a coastline engineer. We got off in a little town and from there caught the bus up to Bundipur. The village is really nice, the old buildings and cobblestone streets give it an almost a European feel, and it is on top of a hill with an amazing view. We left our bags at our hostel on the main street, and walked around for a while, then up to a monestry. From there we could see the Himalayas through the haze. I walked on by myself and came to a little Hindu shrine. An old lady put some ‘tika’ on my forehead, gave me a mandarin to eat, and then put up my hair and put flowers in it - which is apparently only customary to girls. We walked up the hill to see the temple, the view of the mountains, and the sunset, it was very nice. As it got dark we settled down for dinner at a little cafe on the main street.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Ghorka</h3>
          <p>I played mandolin, practising to play standing up without looking by doing so on our balcony while taking in the happenings of the street below. After a short walk through the streets we left Bundipur early, walking down into the cloud shrouded forest - it was an eerie kind of beauty. We came to the region’s famous cave, and went inside. It was completely dark and the way was difficult at first, and then it flattened out and we came across a little candle-lit camp where a meditator was living. In order to make the most of the acoustics, I played some mandolin in the dark, and it sounded very impressive. We continued walking down through the forest and came to the town. While I waited I watched a group of locals very enthusiastically play a game which resembled kelly pool played with little disks flicked by the finger rather than balls and cues. We caught a bus and then another to Ghorka, where we had lunch and went to a local festival. It consisted of food, rides, and a stage which might have had live music later. One of the attractions was a circular wall which a couple motorbikes would ride around on a steep angle. It was very busy and so we soon left and waited at the bus station for our next bus. We had the back seat, shared between seven people and many bags of rice. It was very dusty and bumpy, but it was a good view. We arrived in time to watch the sunset over the village from Shiva’s parent’s place. The house was in a very small farming village tucked into the hillside, in a region which seemed very untouched from the outside world - Shiva said I was probably the fourteenth foreigner to visit. It was very peaceful and quiet, and everything happened at a slow pace. I sat on the bench out the front and watched as Shiva’s father took a very old, hardened corn cob from a crack in the roof, and used it to grind the corn off of a more fresh cob of corn. He then cooked the corn over the fire until only about a quarter of it had popped, and then served it like that with soya beans. It was quite hard to eat, but good. As it got dark Shiva and I played mandolin and flute, and then had a dinner of rice pudding.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">The village life and the walk of friendliness</h3>
          <p>We went for a walk around the village, past the school and to an amazing temple which had fallen down and was now an overgrown ruin centred with a beautiful tree decorated with strings of flower, patches of yellow and red paint, and bells. It also had an awesome view of the distant Himalayas. After walking back we had breakfast, and a friend of Shiva’s came around for a chat; through Shiva’s translations we talked about Australia. Shiva and I then walked the other way, and saw more of the village. I played some mandolin as we had a lunch of tea, popcorn and soya beans. Then we started the walk to Shiva’s mother-in-law’s village. It was just along the range, about three hours away on foot. As we walked we took in the amazing views of the rice paddied hills, low cloud and distant mountains. The locals were all astonished to see me walk by, and it made me feel great saying namaste with a bow and watching them light up with joy and do the same back to me - they have a proverb which translates to ‘a guest is like a god’ and I feel like they very much believe it. Along the way Shiva and I were talking and he said that I am much like a younger version of himself, and have some Buddhahood; it was one of the greatest compliments I have ever received. Somila’s home village was much like Shiva’s, and the house I liked even more so, because I had an awesome little room on top of the stables, and because the extended family were always around, including the young and happy nephews and nieces. We watched the sunset and chatted - although I couldn’t understand any of the parts Shiva didn’t translate for me. One of the buffalos hadn’t come back from grazing, and so the men all went out looking for it. I was left with the women and the children - who were teaching me a little Nepali in return for English, by process of pointing at things in the house and naming them. The men returned before dinner and gravely announced that the buffalo had likely been killed by a tiger that they had found the fresh droppings of.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Back to the Apex</h3>
          <p>After waking up I sat on the deck and appreciated the view. We had a breakfast of Dhal Baht, and then said our goodbyes - Somila’s mum gave me some lavender, twenty rupees, and a tika dot on my forehead. I gave her a thousand rupees and a bow. Then we walked through the village to the top of the hill and caught the bus, it was sad to leave so early. The view was amazing, for a thick blanket of cloud covered the valley floor below us.
          </p><p>From Ghorka Shiva returned to Kathmandu and I caught a bus to Pokhara once more. On the way I ate butter cookies I had bought at a roadside stop, struggled to talk to the Nepali girl next to me, messaged friends from home, watched the landscape fly by, and listened to the Nepali music; which was actually growing on me a bit, although that could have just been because it was played at a reasonable volume and seemed to be on a more chilled out radio channel.
          </p><p>We arrived at Pokhara and I walked for half an hour or so to lakeside, and back to my fave hotel; the apex hotel. The owner was very glad to see me back and led me to the same awesome room overlooking the street. I went out and found a necklace maker to help me make a necklace from my termite marked piece of wood, it turned out really good. Then I bought some gifts for friends.
          </p><p>I walked along the lake to find somewhere for dinner, and stopped at a place with a cool looking upstairs area. I took off my shoes as custom and chose a cushion by the edge with the view, but then was invited over to a table by Lura, Jamie and Stephanie. They were very interesting and talked a lot about yoga and meditation. Lura had eyes that seemed to be bursting with happiness and excitement. I told them about my time in the villages and they were quite amazed. They just had tea and left for dinner elsewhere, and so did I. I found a place that had nice live music, a view of the street from the second story, and really nice naan.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Day Thirty Two</h3>
          <p>I walked down to the crepe place with the view, but it was closed so I headed back. A shoe shiner grabbed me and fixed my shoes, and in return I bought him a small packet of oil as he wished. I had a nice lemon sugar pancake at the little place across from my room, and then I walked back down the street and found a tailor to put some additional pockets on my mando case - another small step towards travelling the world as a busker.
          </p><p>I then found a place with wifi and took my laptop in to use the internet while having a croissant. When the internet got slow I picked up my mandolin case with the nice new pockets, and moved to the Babylon cafe - the cool place with floor seating on the second story, where I continued to research amplifiers while having a pizza for lunch.
          </p><p>For dinner I went back to the place which had live music right on the lake, and this time had a vege burger. It was really good, surprisingly, which I was quite happy about due to my new vegetarianism. I had a hot chocolate as well while I listened to the band play amazing covers of popular songs. Then, inspired but tired, I walked back to my room and learnt some new songs before going to sleep.

          <p>I went to ‘The Silk Road’ for breakfast. There I found a seat in the garden outside with a friendly dog to pat, had some good banana pancakes, and used the internet to do planning. I also downloaded some sheet music and then spent much of the day learning new songs; mostly summer of ‘69 and stand by me. Relaxing in my room I finished my article on travelling Nepal with kids and attached prayer flags to my mandolin.
          </p><p>I had lunch at a little place right on the lake and there did some reading. I walked into old Pokhara, checking in on the skate park which proved quiet on the way through, and bought a little bell for busking. I did some writing in the afternoon, and played more mandolin. I don’t know where the day went, but soon I was going out for dinner at another little place on the lake. Afterwards I got a banana caramel slice for dessert and it was really good, I’ll have to learn to cook such a thing.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Sarangkot</h3>
          <p>I walked down to the lake and enjoyed the early morning before the restaurants began to open. I had a cinnamon and icecream crepe at a place with a rooftop with a good view and wifi, which I used to do a few little things. I checked out of my hostel, bought a few things from the bakery to have for lunch later, and then started walking. I must have missed the main track to Sarangkot, because eventually I came to ‘The Happy Village’ and took a lesser known trail from there. It was a thousand metres up, most of the way was through farming land looking down on the lake and the city. I got lost a couple times once I got to the villages surrounding Sarangkot, but eventually found my way to the hill top in the afternoon.
          </p><p>The mountains were covered in cloud, but I stayed at the view point for a while anyway taking in the valley. Then I found a hostel, a little family ran place with no hot water but a good yard with views of the lake. In this yard I played mandolin, much to the interest of the kids, until the sun set. Then I had dinner there too, it was nice.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">The trek through Methlang</h3>
          <p>I woke up early and went up to the view point to see the sunrise. It was crouded, but I found a place to sit by myself around a corner below the viewing platform. The sunrise was pretty amazing, and then the mountains were lit up on the other side, no longer shrouded in cloud, which was also an amazing view.
          </p><p>After some lemon sugar pancakes at my hostel I headed off back to Pokhara. I decided, as I had all day, to not take the forest trail and instead explore along the hilly range leading to Methlang. I got lost many times, but the local villagers always set me back on track, and it seemed there were many ways down. The views over the lake and the city were great, and the villages I walked through were really nice and quiet - they seemed very untouched by the city just a few hundred metres below them. The last hour of the trek was through a forest, and I saw many monkeys.
          </p><p>Once back in Pokhara, I booked out my favourite hostel room for the third time. I relaxed there for a bit and then went back to the tailors to make another addition to my mandolin bag. Around sunset I walked up and down Lakeside, and got some corn to eat by the lake.
          </p><p>For dinner I went to The Silk Road, and sat around the fire with the owner, a friend of his, a tourist who comes back every year, a Nepali girl who told me about her plans to go to UQ, a Nepali guy who said I looked like I was from Lord of the Rings, and a traveller who agreed and said I looked like Aragorn. There was an amazing band doing reggae covers of popular songs, the vocalist had awesome dredlocks and sung with so much emotion it was like he was going to break down and cry or go crazy at any moment.

          <p>I was sick all night, and so had no energy in the morning. I just laid in bed and did some reading on buddhism on my phone. I went down to the lake and meditated, then walked along Lakeside and bought a muffin - it was amazing because I was so hungry. I played mandolin, practising doing so while standing without looking at the fretboard. Then I went to the crepe place for lunch and used the wifi.
          </p><p>In the afternoon I rested some more, then went for a walk around the local parts of Pokhara. I hired a skateboard and skated at the park, it was good. Eventually I learnt to drop in reasonably well. I played some more mandolin, once again standing and getting into it - and singing as well. I then went down to the lake just for a while to take in the sunset, and then went back to my hostel and had a very much needed shower. I did some writing before going back to the silk road for dinner.

          <p>The bus to Kathmandu left early, and took most of the day. I listened to lots of Radical Face and ‘Peaceful, the world lays me down’ while watching the countryside pass by. I walked back to Machupokhari from Thamel and when I got home Somila made me rice pudding and tea. I then played some mandolin and learnt some new stuff. We had dinner with Somila’s brother.

          <h3 style="width: 300px">Exploring Kathmandu</h3>
          <p>I had my first full cup of coffee, and then before breakfast I managed to learn more parts of ‘Hopeless Wanderer’, ‘Stand by me’, and ‘Summer of 69’. Maybe I should have coffee more often. I wanted to explore the sights of Kathmandu that I hadn’t seen yet, so Shiva got me onto a bus going along the Ring Road.
          </p><p>First I walked around the Pushimati Temple, where the bodies are cremated by the river. It was very sad to see the families carrying their dead to the pyres, crying as they did so. From there I walked to the Bouddhanath Stupor, where hundreds of monks were praying together on it’s mandala base. I walked around the outside once, then along the mandala once, and then after lunch at a nearby rooftop place, once more to make the standard three circuits.
          </p><p>I walked back to the Ring Road and managed to catch a bus back to Machu Pokhari. Once home I played some mandolin and came across the beginnings of a new tune of mine.

          <p>After the usual tea and mandolin, I spent my last morning deciding whether or not I would make a last minute change of plans and go to India to volunteer in the monasteries like Mara was. She was telling me all about it over messenger, and it sounded amazing, but eventually I decided it would be better to come back with everything organised sometime.
          </p><p>Shiva caught the bus with me to the airport, where he placed a Buddhist scarf over my head and said goodbye. I listened to ‘Babel’ while I waited for my plane.
          </p><p>The view of the Himalayas out the window was amazing. I made friends with the Nepali guys beside me. From Abu Dhabi I then caught my connection onto Perth.
